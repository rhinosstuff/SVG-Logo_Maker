  [![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](./LICENSE)

  ## Description
  This is my week 10-Challenge. In this challenge I was to create a simple SVG logo generator from scratch. It will take in a few questions from the command line using "inquirer" then generate a svg file based on user input. I also needed to implement "jest" for testing the application.
